I'm currently a Master student in Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, specializing in Computational Data Science. I received my bachelor degree of Computer Software in Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. 

During my study in Tsinghua I'd been making efforts to turn Computer Science technology into social values. I developed yunimpact.com with [Helium Chen](http://weibo.com/heliumchen?topnav=1&wvr=5&topsug=1). Though the website didn't make it to a successful business, it was still a precious experience to me. Afterward, I joined the founder team of [Qi-Ming-He-Xin](http://www.hexin.im/) in developing software to bring evolution to traditional K12 education, and my teammates and I had done some great things. 

I'm interested in **Machine Learning**, **Data Science and Business Intelligence**. You can expect to see some posts about these topics in my blog in the future. 

I love music, and I play guitar. Kotaro Oshio is my favorite guitar player, and my favorite song is [Twilight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2wkX70kDAw).
